# IceDMX
IceDMX is a work-in-progress USB to DMX interface, potentially supporting up to twelve universes off a single iCEstick. This is all (currently) being built to run on the iCEstick, although I plan to later use this code on the Snickerdoodle for a future project.

# How to use
It's a work in progress. Unusable right now, and even then there probably won't be any decent software supporting it for a while.
